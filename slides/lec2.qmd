## What is The Grammar of Graphics?

::: incremental
- The grammar of graphics is a framework for visualizing data.
- It helps us understand each aspect of visualization, such as:
- Data, aesthetic, geometry, scale, etc.
:::

## How is This Useful?

::: incremental
- This framework is used for data visualization for many programming languages and packages, not just for ggplot in R.
- Examples: matplotlib in Python, Tableau, and more.
- Although we are learning R specifically for this course, the grammar of graphics is used throughout statistics.

## Throwback Example:

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island)) + geom_bar()
```
