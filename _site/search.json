For more information please read the Honor Code Guide for Syllabi.\nWe expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work togetherâ€”but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the Center for the Student Conduct.\nIf you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. Rather than copying someone elseâ€™s work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed.
